# PARTUM iNSULAE (UNITY URP) FREE
Free educational version of the PARTUM iNSULAE experience.

## The PARTUM iNSULAE Experience
The PARTUM iNSULAE Experience is a long term (multi-year) project, which will consist of a collection of applications where a participant can relax and wind down in beautiful virtual environments.

### Applications
This application will be developed using the following applications (simultaneously):
* <b>Unity</b>
  * URP Free version (this repository); This version will be used for educational purposes (both for myself and for anyone interested in this project).
  * URP Patreon version; For those who are interested in the URP version of the project and want to support adding paid assets.
  * HDRP Patreon version; For those who are interested in the HDRP version of the project and want to support adding paid assets.

#### Virtual Reality Spin-Off / End Goal
Once I find a Virtual Reality helmet that is capable of rendering high quality virtual environments and which will be comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, I will also create a Virtual Reality version. This Virtual Reality environment will be the holy grail and end goal of this project. The challenge until then is to write the code in a manner that will make it easy to use it in the Virtual Reality application.

#### Patreon
Those who are willing to contribute to the project via Patreon will get access to the following:
* Executables of the applications with paid assets
* The opportunity to vote for which paid assets should be included
* A large version of a Midjourney render of choice
